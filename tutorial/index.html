<div>
    <p>You've just created a simple Play Framework application with play-yeoman plugin configured.</p>
    
    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    
    <p>
        You need to have npm, bower, yeoman and grunt installed before doing anything else. Please follow the instructions at <a href="http://yeoman.io/">yeoman.io</a> to get started.
    </p>

    <h3>Initialize the application</h3>

    <p>
        Before you start building the application, use yeoman generator on the SBT console to create your web application. <br/>
        For example to create an agular web application use,
        <quote>
            sbt> yo angular
        </quote>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Run the application</h3>
    
    <p>
        To run the application, you can use the standard play run command. This will run grunt and build the web app.<br/>
        <quote>
            sbt> run
        </quote>
        
    </p>

    <h3>View the App</h3>

    <p>
        Once the application has been compiled and the server started, your application can be accessed at: <a href="http://localhost:9000" target="_blank">http://localhost:9000</a><br/>
        Check in <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> to see the server status.<br/>
